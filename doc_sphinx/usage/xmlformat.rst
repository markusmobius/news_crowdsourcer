XML Format
==========

This section describes the structure of the XML file used for
describing an experiment (see :ref:`survey_tab` for how to upload the XML file
to Crowdsourcr).

For instructional examples, load and view (in labeled order) the files located in the examples folder. 

The main structure of the XML file is as follows:
::

 <xml>
   <modules>
     ... module definitions ...
   </modules>
   <tasks>
     ... task definitions ...
   </tasks>
   <hits>
     ... hit definitions ...
   </hits>
   <sets>
     ... set definitions ...
   </sets>
   <documents>
     ... document definitions ...
   </documents>
 </xml>

The ``documents`` and ``sets`` sections are optional if it is empty, otherwise the
first three are required.

Modules
-------

A module has an internal name, a visible header, and a list of
questions:
::

 <module>
   <name>module_name</name>
   <header>Visible Module Header</header>
   <questions>
     ... question definitions ...
   </questions>
 </module>

Questions
---------

There are a few types of questions which have been defined.  The
general format for a question definition is
::

 <question>
   <varname>internal_variable_name</varname>
   <questiontext>Visible question text</questiontext>
   (<helptext>Optional help text</helptext>)
   <valuetype>some_value_type</valuetype>
   ...
 </question>

The variable name is for determining how the answer is recorded into
the response data.  The value type determines how the question is
rendered.

Numeric questions
+++++++++++++++++

A numeric question (value type ``numeric``) displays as a text box
that only accepts a number.  An example:

.. figure:: ../doc_img/crowdsourcer_numeric.png
   :align: center

::

 <question>
   <varname>age</varname>
   <valuetype>numeric</valuetype>
   <questiontext>What is your age?</questiontext>
   <helptext>This is your age in years.</helptext>
 </question>

Text questions
++++++++++++++

A text question (value type ``text``) displays as a text box that
accepts any non-empty textual content.  An example:

.. figure:: ../doc_img/crowdsourcer_text.png
   :align: center

::

 <question>
   <varname>thoughts</varname>
   <valuetype>text</valuetype>
   <questiontext>What were your overall perceptions of the survey?
     Which questions were most confusing? You may also submit any
     other comments that you may have.</questiontext>
   <helptext>We want to better understand the strenghts and weaknesses
     of our survey in order to improve it for future workers. Your
     answer to this question will not influence your
     payment.</helptext>
  </question>

There is also an approximate text question (value type ``approximatetext``). This displays the same way as a normal text question.
However, for bonus calculations, two submissions are considered to match if their Jaccard similarity exceeds 75 percent.


Categorical questions
+++++++++++++++++++++

A categorical question (value type ``categorical``) displays as a set
of radio buttons that accepts exactly one response.  An example:

.. figure:: ../doc_img/crowdsourcer_categorical.png
   :align: center

::

 <question>
   <varname>married</varname>
   <questiontext>Are you married?</questiontext>
   <helptext>Please answer metaphorically.</helptext>
   <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
   <content>
     <categories>
       <category>
         <text>Yes</text>
         <value>yes</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>No</text>
         <value>no</value>
       </category>
     </categories>
   </content>
 </question>

The ``text`` element holds what is shown to the worker, and the
``value`` element holds what is recorded to the database for that
categorical response.

Each category also has an optional parameter ``aprioripermissable`` which can be set to ``true`` or ``false`` (if missing it is set to ``false``).

::

        <question>
          <varname>favoritecolor</varname>
          <questiontext>Which color do you like better?</questiontext>
          <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
          <content>
            <categories>
              <category>
                <text>Red</text>
                <value>red</value>
                <aprioripermissable>true</aprioripermissable>
              </category>
              <category>
                <text>Blue</text>
                <value>blue</value>
                <aprioripermissable>true</aprioripermissable>
              </category>
            </categories>
          </content>
        </question>

This parameter matters for bonus calculations: if there is any conditional branching that omits certain tasks or questions 
that involves any condition with ``aprioripermissable`` variables then the share of agreement for bonus purposes is biased
only on the number of workers who ended up in this branch and not on the number of workers who could have seen this question.

This is used, for example, in the ``elaborate_conditional_tasks.xml`` survey. In that survey, workers are first asked
for their favorite color (red or blue) and both colors are apriori permissable (meaning there is no right or wrong answer).
Depending on the color choice, the survey then asks if this light is in the low or high-frequency part of the spectrum (which involves two conditional tasks).
The frequency questions are incentivized with bonus points.

Since the color choices are marked as apriori permissable the bonus points for the red frequency question are only calculated
relative to the majority answer among people who chose ``red``. For example, if 4 people complete the survey correctly and
two of them have favorite color ``red'' and two have ``blue`` then the agreement level will be 100 percent. Otherwise, the agreement 
level would be only 50 percent since only 2 people answered the frequency question identically (out of a possible 4 who
could have answered this question).


Nested categorical questions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For some questions, it is better to show categorical options
hierarchically.  The syntax is exactly the same for ``categorical``
questions, except that the ``text`` elements hold ``|``-separated
options.  The responses will be shown in a tree-like fashion.  An example:

.. figure:: ../doc_img/crowdsourcer_categorical_nested.png
   :align: center

::

 <question>
   <varname>level_category</varname>
   <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
   <questiontext>What is this category?</questiontext>
   <content>
     <categories>
       <category>
         <text>Hard|Science|Interesting</text>
         <value>hard_science_interesting</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>Hard|Law</text>
         <value>hard_law</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>Hard|Science|Difficult</text>
         <value>hard_science_difficult</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>Hard|Science|Boring</text>
         <value>hard_science_boring</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>Soft|Animals</text>
         <value>soft</value>
       </category>
     </categories>
   </content>
 </question>


It is possible to have optional specificity.  For example, if we added
a category with text ``Soft|Animals|Teddy Bear`` to the above
definition, then a user could answer either ``Soft|Animals`` or the
sub-category ``Soft|Animals|Teddy Bear``.

Scale questions
+++++++++++++++

For some categorical questions, the options are along a scale that is
best presented horizontally.  This is specified using the
``horizontal`` layout in the ``options`` element for the question.  An
example:

.. figure:: ../doc_img/crowdsourcer_scale.png
   :align: center

::

 <question>
   <varname>bias</varname>
   <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
   <questiontext>How biased is this?</questiontext>
   <options>
     <layout>horizontal</layout>
     <lowLabel>Conservative</lowLabel>
     <highLabel>Liberal</highLabel>
     <outsideCategories>N/A</outsideCategories>
     <outsideCategories>Unsure</outsideCategories>
   </options>
   <content>
     <categories>
       <category>
         <text>1</text>
         <value>1</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>2</text>
         <value>2</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>3</text>
         <value>3</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>4</text>
         <value>4</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>5</text>
         <value>5</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>6</text>
         <value>6</value>
       </category>
     </categories>
   </content>
 </question>

Image upload questions
++++++++++++++++++++++

You can upload images (up to 16MB per question). 

::

  <question>
    <varname>nyt_logo</varname>
    <questiontext>Please upload a nytlogo</questiontext>
    <valuetype>imageupload</valuetype>
  </question>

The variable will only store an image hash. The raw BASE64-encoded image will be stored under a second variable with suffix ``_raw``
added. For example, ``nyt_logo`` will become ``ny_logo_raw`` while ``nyt_logo`` will hold the hash. The image hash allows you to
compare the similarity through simple differences. A threshold difference of 20 is internally used for defining two images
as identical for bonus calculations.

Tasks
-----

Each task consists of a document that is shown on the left screen and a set of modules that are shown on the right. 

.. figure:: ../doc_img/crowdsourcer_task_example_news_scaled.png
   :alt: An example task.
   :align: center

The sample XML file ``simple_question_conditional_hit.xml`` has the following three tasks:

::

  <tasks>
    <task>
      <content>screening.html</content>
      <taskid>1</taskid>
      <modules>screening</modules>
    </task>
    <task>
      <content>spelling.html</content>
      <taskid>2</taskid>
      <modules>spelling</modules>
    </task>	
    <task>
      <content>demographics.html</content>
      <taskid>3</taskid>
      <modules>demographics</modules>
    </task>	
  </tasks>

In this example, every task has just one associated module. The ``complex_modules.xml`` survey shows an example where tasks have several modules. This XML file generates the screenshot above.

The ``content`` value refers to a document that is defined under ``documents``:

::

  <documents>
    <document>
      <name>screening.html</name>
      <content><![CDATA[
      <p>On this page we screen you.</p>
      ]]></content>
    </document>
    <document>
      <name>spelling.html</name>
      <content><![CDATA[
      <p>Please answer these questions.</p>
      ]]></content>
    </document>
    <document>
      <name>demographics.html</name>
      <content><![CDATA[
      <p>On this page we ask questions about yourself.</p>
      ]]></content>
    </document>
  </documents>

 
Any HTML content can be provided under the content property (you can even use it to load external images through ``<img src="http://my_other_domain/my_image.png">``) but you need to encapsulate your HTML in a CDATA tag in order to produce valid XML.
The ``complex_modules.xml`` survey provides an example of very rich content panels.

Dynamic content
+++++++++++++++

You can make the content change dynamically when switching between modules within a task.

The sample XML file ``color_coding_test.xml`` shows an example where the names of different political candidates are highlighted depending
on the module.

.. figure:: ../doc_img/crowdsourcer_dynamic_content.png
   :align: center

Dynamic content can be included by adding the ``contentUpdate`` tag as shown below:

::

  <module>
    <header>Questions on Joe Biden</header>
	  <contentUpdate>highlight;joebiden</contentUpdate>
    <name>joebiden</name>
    <questions>
      <question>
        <varname>joebiden</varname>
        <questiontext>How many instances of Joe Biden do you see on the left?</questiontext>
        <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
        <content>
          <categories>
            <category>
              <text>One</text>
              <value>1</value>
            </category>
            <category>
              <text>Two</text>
              <value>2</value>
            </category>
            <category>
              <text>More than 2</text>
              <value>2+</value>
            </category>
          </categories>
        </content>
      </question>
    </questions>
  </module>

The tag consists of two strings separated by semi-colon. ``highlight`` indicates that the corresponding Javascript function should
be called when the user switches to this module with value ``joebiden``. 

The content HTML code looks as follows:

::

  <documents>
    <document>
      <name>names.html</name>
      <content><![CDATA[
	  <style>
		.yellow {
			background-color: yellow
			}
		.green {
			background-color: #8FBC8F
			}			
	  </style>
	  <script>
	  var highlight=function(name){
		var tags=document.getElementsByTagName("SPAN");
		for (let tag of tags) {
			if (tag.getAttribute("nameMarker")==name){
				if (name=="joebiden"){
					tag.className="yellow";
				}
				if (name=="elizabethwarren"){
					tag.className="green";
				}
			}
			else{
				tag.className="";
			}
		}
	  }
	  </script>
	  <p><span nameMarker="joebiden">Joe Biden</span> and <span nameMarker="elizabethwarren">Elizabeth Warren</span> are often mentioned. If I had to guess 
	  then <span nameMarker="elizabethwarren">Elizabeth Warren</span> is mentioned more often than <span nameMarker="joebiden">Joe Biden</span> but I am not sure.	  
      ]]></content>
    </document>
  </documents>



cHits
-----

A cHIT is a collection of tasks. This is what the Turk worker will see when clicking the link in the Amazon interface. Your cHIT will have as many pages as there are tasks. ``simple_question_conditional_hit.xml`` defines 3 cHITs each consisting of three tasks.

::

  <hits>
    <hit>
      <hitid>1</hitid>
      <tasks>1 2 3</tasks>
	  <taskconditions>
			<taskcondition>
				<taskid>2</taskid>
				<condition>
				<![CDATA[
				1*screening*smart+1*screening*kidding+1*screening*sum10+1*screening*sum15+1*screening*biggerthan>=4
				]]>
				</condition>
			</taskcondition>
			<taskcondition>
				<taskid>3</taskid>
				<condition>
				<![CDATA[
				notinset{$workerid,excludedemographics}
				]]>
				</condition>
			</taskcondition>
	  </taskconditions>
    </hit>
    <hit>
      <hitid>2</hitid>
      <tasks>1 2 3</tasks>
    </hit>
    <hit>
      <hitid>3</hitid>
      <tasks>1 2 3</tasks>
    </hit>
  </hits>

In this example, the three tasks 1 to 3 are assigned to three cHITs. This implies triple data entry which makes workers potentially eligible for a bonus payment (see :ref:`bonus` ).


Data Download
+++++++++++++

When you download data in the administrator's :ref:`survey_tab` every question will be coded by ``task_id``, ``module_name`` and ``varname``. Example:

.. figure:: ../doc_img/crowdsourcer_download.png
   :alt: Data download example.
   :align: center


.. _task-condition:

Task Conditions
+++++++++++++++

You can define task conditions on the HIT level which determine which dynamically determine which particular task the worker will see. Consider the cHIT with hid ID 1 in ``simple_question_conditional_hit.xml``:

::

    <hit>
      <hitid>1</hitid>
      <tasks>1 2 3</tasks>
	  <taskconditions>
			<taskcondition>
				<taskid>2</taskid>
				<condition>
				<![CDATA[
				1*screening*smart+1*screening*kidding+1*screening*sum10+1*screening*sum15+1*screening*biggerthan>=4
				]]>
				</condition>
			</taskcondition>
			<taskcondition>
				<taskid>3</taskid>
				<condition>
				<![CDATA[
				notinset{$workerid,excludedemographics}
				]]>
				</condition>
			</taskcondition>
	  </taskconditions>
    </hit>

In this cHIT tasks 1 is a screening task, task 2 is the actual worker task we are interested in and task 3 collects demographic data on the worker. 

- We don't want the worker to do the worker task (and potentially collect a bonus) if she does badly in the screen task. This is accomplished through the first condition

::

				<condition>
				<![CDATA[
				1*screening*smart+1*screening*kidding+1*screening*sum10+1*screening*sum15+1*screening*biggerthan>=4
				]]>
				</condition>

- We also do not want the worker to complete the demographic survey if she previously filled it out. This is accomplished through the second condition:

::

				<condition>
				<![CDATA[
				notinset{$workerid,excludedemographics}
				]]>
				</condition>

Set conditions rely on sets to be defined in the XML like this:

::

  <sets>
	<set>
		<name>excludedemographics</name>
		<members>mm lilia</members>
	</set>
  </sets>


A couple of comments on the syntax of the conditions are in order:

- You have to refer to variables by using their full path which consists of task id, module name and variable name. Separate the three parts of the full variable name with the '*' character.
- Encapsulate the condition in a CDATA tag to ensure valid XML.
- There are 3 types of basic boolean conditions: 
      -  Equality (``==``) and inequality (``!=``) such as ``1*screening*smart==1``.
	  -  Arithmetic sums of variables as long as the values are integers (non-integer values will be ignored at runtime). You can apply equality (``==``), inequality (``!=``) 
		 and the arithmetic comparisons greater or equal (``>=``) and less or equal (``<=``).
	  -  The ``inset`` and ``notinset`` operators which check whether a variable is contained in a set (in this case ``excludedemographics``).
	  -  ``$workerid`` is a special variable which indicates the ID of the worker.
- You can concatenate any type of basic boolean condition using the AND operator ``&`` and the OR operator ``|``. You can also use brackets to nest conditions. 

The syntax parser will check while uploading the XML that all conditions are valid (except for summation errors due to variables taking non-integer values).

	  
Conditional Questions
---------------------

The display of questions can be made conditional on the answer to other  questions by specifying a ``<condition>``:

::

        <question>
          <varname>spelling</varname>		 
          <bonus>threshold:50</bonus>
          <questiontext>Please indicate which spelling is correct:</questiontext>
          <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
          <content>
            <categories>
              <category>
                <text>Rhythm</text>
                <value>0</value>
              </category>
              <category>
                <text>Rythm</text>
                <value>1</value>
              </category>
              <category>
                <text>Other spelling</text>
                <value>other</value>
              </category>
            </categories>
          </content>
        </question>
        <question>
          <varname>spelling_other</varname>
		      <condition>
			  <![CDATA[
			  spelling==other
			  ]]>
			  </condition>
          <bonus>threshold:50</bonus>
		      <bonuspoints>2</bonuspoints>
          <questiontext>Please specify the spelling.</questiontext>
          <valuetype>text</valuetype>
        </question>
        <question>
          <varname>letterc</varname>		 
          <questiontext>What does the letter C stand for?</questiontext>
          <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
          <content>
            <categories>
              <category>
                <text>C is for cookie</text>
                <value>cookie</value>
              </category>
              <category>
                <text>C is for car</text>
                <value>car</value>
              </category>
            </categories>
          </content>
        </question>

The parser for conditions is the same as for :ref:`task-condition`. However, variable definitions are simplified and only use the variable name because conditions only apply within the context of a module.

.. _bonus:

Bonus
---------

Crowdsourcr has an extensive bonus point framework. Bonus points serve two functions:

First of all, they provide a currency to reward extra questions. This is useful when you have a lot of conditional branching
and some hits might take longer than others. Second, you can reward accuracy by awarding bonus points for a task depending on the 
level of agreement of the worker with other workers who completed the same task.

Specifying a bonus
++++++++++++++++++

Bonuses can be specified on a per-question basis by adding a ``<bonus>``
element to the XML file. If a question has no ``<bonus>`` element 
then there are 0 bonus points assigned. Each question with the  ``<bonus>`` element has one bonus point assigned.
This can be changed by adding a ``<bonuspoints>`` element. To always assign bonus points regardless of the answers
of other players use ``<bonus>threshold:0</bonus>``.

In the example below, the worker has the option of answering an extra question for which she receives 
2 bonus points.

::

 <question>
   <varname>article_extra</varname>
   <questiontext>Do you want to answer an optional question? You will receive a bonus payment for answering optional questions.</questiontext>
   <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
   <content>
     <categories>
       <category>
         <text>Yes</text>
         <value>yes</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>No</text>
         <value>no</value>
       </category>
     </categories>
   </content>
 </question>
 <question>
   <varname>article_type</varname>
   <questiontext>What kind of article is this?</questiontext>
	 <condition>
			  <![CDATA[
			  article_extra==yes
			  ]]>
	 </condition>
   <bonus>threshold:0</bonus>
   <bonuspoints>2</bonuspoints>
   <valuetype>categorical</valuetype>
   <content>
     <categories>
       <category>
         <text>News article</text>
         <value>news</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>Editorial</text>
         <value>editorial</value>
       </category>
       <category>
         <text>Other</text>
         <value>other</value>
       </category>
     </categories>

The actual dollar bonus per worker is calculated as follows: the sum of bonus points on any cHIT is calculated. The maximum
across all these individuals sum is taken. One bonus point is then valued as the bonus amount specified in the admin panel
(see section :ref:`chit_tab`) divided by this maximum number of possible points. For example, in the ``elaborate_conditional_tasks.xml`` survey
the sum of all bonus points for any cHIT equals 4. If the bonus amount is set at 1 Dollar then a bonus point is worth 25 cents. 
Note, that a worker will therefore never earn more than the bonus amount on any single cHIT
specified in the admin panel (although if a worker completes two cHITs then she can earn this amount twice).

Crowdsourcr calculates the sum of bonus points on any cHIT regardless of whether this sum is actually attainable. For
example, the ``elaborate_conditional_tasks.xml`` asks you to pick between color ``red`` and ``blue`` and then asks
a conditional followup question on each response (which is incentivized with two bonus points). The sum of bonus
points on any cHIT is 4 but a worker can only achieve 2 bonus points. Hence, as the survey designer, you need to be aware of the attainable 
bonus points in order to scale the bonus amount appropriately.

Rewarding Agreement
+++++++++++++++++++

Crowdsourcr can automatically award bonuses conditional on agreement between Turkers on each question. This allows one 
to reward Turkers for good performance in multiple entry tasks.

Two kinds of bonus schemes are available:

- linear: a number of bonus points that's a linear function of the share
  of other Turkers who gave the same answer to the task. To use this scheme
  add ``<bonus>linear</bonus>`` to the XML specification
- threshold: an all-or-nothing scheme where the bonus is awarded only if
  the share of Turkers (*including* herself) who gave the same answer to the task weakly 
  exceeds a threshold. To use this scheme add 
  ``<bonus>threshold:51</bonus>`` to the XML specification. Note that with simple 
  double data entry (two workers per task) you would want to set the threshold at 51 at least because otherwise
  every worker receives the bonus (since the share of workers including herself that agrees with her answer is exactly 0.5.)

There are a few rules on how Crowdsourcr determines the level of agreement:

* Crowdsourcr assumes that incentivized bonus questions on the same task have the same answer: it will therefore determine agreement
  among all workers who answered questions on the same task. If you design a survey in a way that on two cHITs you reuse the
  same task but expect different answers you should either not incentivize them with bonus points, or consider creating
  two separate tasks.


* Crowdsourcr calculates the number of workers who agreed with a specific worker on a question and divides this by the number of workers
  who could have answered the same question. This makes the implicit assumption that if the worker's answer is correct
  then other workers' answers have to be wrong. An exception is the case where the conditions for reaching a question only involve 
  ``aprioripermissable`` responses (either on task conditions or question conditions or both): in this case the denominator
  is the set of all workers who satisfied the same conditions (and hence saw the question).

For example, in the ``elaborate_conditional_tasks.xml`` survey the worker answers questions on either red light or blue
light after choosing one of them. Both color choices are ``aprioripermissable`` which implies that agreement on the red (blue)
light tasks is only determined among the users who picked red (blue).
